📈 Normal Distribution (Empirical Rule)
"How data usually spreads out"
- 68% of data within ±1 standard deviation from mean
- 95% of data within ±2 standard deviations from mean
- 99.7% of data within ±3 standard deviations from mean
(Commonly remembered as "68–95–99.7 rule".)

🎲 Monte Carlo vs. Population Sampling
- Monte Carlo: Testing a model already built.
- Population Sampling: Finding unknown real-world truths.

🧠 Sample Size Rule of Thumb
Fewer samples needed for more common occurrences:
- 50%+ occurrence: 200–500 samples
- 10–50% occurrence: 500–2,000 samples
- 1–10% occurrence: 2,000–10,000 samples
- <1% occurrence: 10,000+ samples (huge samples required!)
Example: Dual addiction (<1% occurrence) needs massive sample size.

📊 Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
Average distance from the mean, ignoring direction:
MAD = (1/n) Σ|xi - x̄|

🚨 Kurtosis
How extreme the data's outliers are:
- High kurtosis indicates many extreme values far from mean.
- Standard deviation alone doesn't capture these extremes.

📏 Statistical Moments
Moment | Name     | Simple Explanation   
1st    | Mean     | Center               
2nd    | Variance | Spread               
3rd    | Skewness | Asymmetry (lopsided) 
4th    | Kurtosis | Extremes (tails)     

📌 Standard Error of Mean (SEM)
How precisely the sample mean represents population:
SEM = Standard Deviation / √(sample size (n))

📖 Quick Glossary ("Naked Stats")

- Standard Units (Normalization): Turning different scales into common scale (Z-score)
- Binomial Coefficient: Ways to pick combinations
- Central Limit Theorem: Large sample averages form normal distribution

🎯 Conditional Probability
Probability changes when additional information is known.

🧮 Quick Logarithmic Calculation Reminder
5^100 = 10^(100 log 5) = 10^69.9 ≈ 7.98 × 10^69
